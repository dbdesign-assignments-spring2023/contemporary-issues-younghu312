# Concerns Over Data Collection By TikTok's In App Browser

Today, I want to talk about the ongoing concerns over TikTok's collection of data on their in-app browser, which may be an invasion of users' privacy.

## Article 1
In [TikTok class action alleges company records data outside app use](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/tiktok-fb-in-app-browser-tracking-analysis/), the author talks about how TikTok collects users' private information without their consent. "Through its in-app browser, TikTok has secretly amassed massive amounts of highly invasive information about its users by tracking their activities on third-party websites." TikTok is also accused of "“generate massive revenues by selling and providing access to this data.”

According to the article, TikTok and ByteDance may have violated the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and the Federal Wiretap Act. If the above accusations are true, TikTok may be guilty of invading users' privacy, which can be dangerous. I believe we should all be concerned about illegal data collection because it may be used to manipulate public opinions, or have other unknown consequences. 

## Article 2
In [TikTok’s in-app browser could be keylogging, privacy analysis warns](https://techcrunch.com/2022/08/19/tiktok-fb-in-app-browser-tracking-analysis/), the article mentions TikTok's response to this ongoing concern. TikTok states that their app is not doing anything malicious, and the data collected is solely used for debugging, troubleshooting, and performance monitoring. It also suggests that information may only be analyzed locally on the device without being collected by TikTok. Moreover, TikTok also states that "the level of data gathering it engages in is akin to other apps which also collect information about what users search for within the app to be able to recommend relevant content and personalize the service." 

I believe in today's era of information technology, no one can prevent their personal information from being collected by all kinds of apps and companies. Sometimes these data can be useful to optimize our experience in apps, but oftentimes they can pose a security threat to us. Everybody should try to be aware of what kinds of personal data are being collected and be cautious of any personal data being leaked.
